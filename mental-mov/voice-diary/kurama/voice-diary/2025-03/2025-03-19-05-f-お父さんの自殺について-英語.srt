1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:09,400
I just finished work around 6 PM, and I'm listening to it again

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,470
The part about the little devil Ageha is really interesting (laughs). I'm really praising myself

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:20,060
Are you going to spread that kind of story with a little devil like Ageha?

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,130
I was wondering what to start talking about

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,690
I was thinking that there isn't enough discussion about

6
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,830
my father's suicide

7
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,120
So, if I had to sum it up in one word, my father is...

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,290
The existence of 'nothing' is 'nothing'

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,990
I don't know how to put it. Anyway, I'm quiet at home

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:51,440
So, I guess I was around 22 years old, maybe 3 years old

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,100
I left home and started working in Tokyo,

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,420
but the total time I spent talking with my father until then

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,050
was about 2 hours (laughs)

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,160
That might be a bit of an exaggeration, though

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,170
Probably less than a day

16
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,880
It really makes you think about how little we talked, right?

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,070
There aren't any memorable conversations, you know

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,500
That's why it's nothing. It was nothing after all

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,340
I knew he was a kind person, but...

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,500
In the family, he is definitely under his mother's thumb, you know

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,230
No, seriously, it's just a really amazing story

22
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,170
It felt like I was being told to at least argue back a little

23
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,820
But you know, the more you argue, the more it comes back to you

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:51,310
What was that saying about getting double the return?

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:51,600
It's not 'handanaki', what was it again?

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,120
Is this like Hanzawa Naoki? It's a mental Hanzawa Naoki

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,220
And that's why it's hysterical, because it's hysterical Fuwachan,

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,700
so what kind of mix is that?

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:10,000
It's a mix, right? It's already a greedy set. It's a greedy set, you know

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,850
My mother. Ah, that's why

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,300
I think Dad is tired too

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:26,810
Because I get bitten every time. I think that's why he went silent

33
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,590
Yeah, yeah, oh I see, I wonder what that is

34
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,520
Back in elementary school, Tenrikyo

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,940
Ah, I said it

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,380
You know, we used to dance in the morning and evening

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,940
Well, I've already said it, so it doesn't matter,

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,530
but I started getting into it

39
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,880
That's right

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,920
Oh right, I forgot. I had forgotten, but

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,570
It's not that, the story is long, so I'll skip a bit, hmm

42
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:04,000
That's the kind of dad who, well, committed suicide

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
I never thought my own parent would commit suicide

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,370
I didn't think so. February 2020

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:21,570
Well, that was five years ago. I was like, 'What?!'

46
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,120
So, for a while, I was kind of confused. I was confused, you know

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:38,040
I have to attend a funeral, right? And it's far away in the countryside. It's about two hours from the metropolitan area. It's not that far, though

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,380
It's not really that far, or something like that

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,940
I felt like it was a bit farther away, but for me, it's far

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,950
Two hours. Being jostled around on a train for two hours is torture, and I'm a recluse

51
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,730
Is that really how much you use it?

52
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,430
It's kind of that vibe

53
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,740
So, two hours on the train,

54
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:06,250
even if it's for my father's funeral, was really a hassle

55
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,720
So maybe I don't have to go

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,630
I didn't love them that much, you know? It was like that. What a messed up person

57
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,550
Well, if you think about it, I am a messed up person

58
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:24,100
But, you know, I thought to myself that I couldn't just not show up, so I reconsidered and went out

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,190
So, it's about the psychological depiction during the funeral and stuff

60
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:37,860
It takes a lot of time, so I'll skip that part. Yeah, in the end, I thought it was good that I went. Of course, that's true (laughs)

61
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,690
But still, it's a matter of not overthinking it

62
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,320
Yeah, I did overthink it. It was a hassle, and I didn't really like it that much,

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,260
so I thought you guys could just handle it on your own

64
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,370
Honestly, that's how I felt

65
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,010
So, after the funeral,

66
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,910
my father's figure keeps flashing in my mind

67
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,090
It really keeps flashing. The changes in his mind leading up to his suicide, you know?

68
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,810
That kind of thing really hits you in the heart

69
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,870
It's really coming. My house is in the countryside, you know

70
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,600
It's quite spacious. It's about 1,000 tsubo

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,590
I'm not sure

72
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,290
if 1,000 tsubo

73
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,990
is considered spacious,

74
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,390
but it's pretty big, you know

75
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:37,280
The place where the suicide happened, um, it's like a storage area for agricultural machinery

76
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,140
It's what you might call a row house

77
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,220
It's quite large and made of corrugated metal

78
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,570
When I say large, I mean it's about 20 meters long

79
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,570
Well, it's in a place where farming tools and things like threshers are kept

80
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:58,210
So, there's a small house at the edge of the property,

81
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:06,160
and the father is currently living about 100 meters away from that house

82
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,120
It might not even be 100 meters

83
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,430
I'm not sure, but it's around that distance

84
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,380
Up to that tenement where the suicide happened,

85
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:23,460
I imagine what kind of feelings I had while walking there, and it comes to me, you know

86
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:32,730
Because, even if I had resolved to commit suicide,

87
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,100
it's tough, right? Yeah, I think it's tough

88
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,130
But we can overcome that

89
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,000
What I'm trying to say is...

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,300
In the end, it was what drove my father to suicide

91
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,220
So, what I mean is

92
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,400
In the end, I think it was all about not wanting to be a burden to my family

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,210
Yeah, so when I talked to my brother about it at that time,

94
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,030
"I felt like I had no value in life anymore," or something like that

95
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,230
It seems like they were mumbling about that. Yeah

96
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,370
Right, I think it's pretty amazing

97
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,230
Because, in essence, it's like dying

98
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,420
for someone else

99
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,860
Even though it's not exactly someone else

100
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:19,010
Dying for family. Yeah, with the sole intention of not wanting to burden the family, they ended up dying

101
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:25,660
It's really heartbreaking, I think it's a painful heart

102
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,910
Hmm, it's like I realized you died for me

103
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,880
Now, it's really hitting me, and when I look back...

104
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,380
Well, I'm just living in decadence, aren't I? I think it's bad

105
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,480
and I need to do something about it, but...

106
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,110
Well, it's more like I can't do anything because I've become so lazy

107
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,860
Well, what should I do? I don't even know what I should do

108
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,780
I was troubled and troubled

109
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,910
So what I did was start a diet (laughs)

110
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,780
Like, a diet there?

111
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:13,480
Where and how do you connect to make it a diet? Something like that

112
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it would be interesting if we traced that out,

113
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,900
but the story there is long. And it's long and interesting

114
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,210
In my mind. That's why

115
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,770
That's that, and there's no need to talk about it separately. Yeah, it's fine, though

116
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,770
Hmm, about that father of yours, um,

117
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,710
how should I put it?

118
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,090
When I stood at the funeral, you know

119
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,210
Dad was already so skinny

120
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,900
Hmm, he was really skinny

121
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,590
The reason is that his swallowing function, in other words,

122
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:51,870
the ability to swallow food, seemed to have decreased

123
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,900
It seems that due to that, I couldn't eat food,

124
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,840
it became difficult to eat, and I ended up in a situation

125
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,940
like being emaciated and having a rectal prolapse

126
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,410
A rectal prolapse is when the intestines come out from the anus,

127
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,480
and you have to hurriedly push them back in

128
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,730
While experiencing that feeling of becoming more and more useless, I think the meaning of my existence, well,

129
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:22,960
you know, is probably something like depression

130
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:30,200
I think I was really troubled and tried to commit suicide

131
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:39,470
But the circumstances leading up to that were all about not wanting to burden my family. It was all love, really

132
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,210
I was loved that much. It's just overwhelming

133
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:51,840
I mean, my dad was amazing; he overcame the fear of death purely out of love

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,920
I thought it was amazing

135
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,350
Dad, you're cool, yeah

136
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,610
For the first time, towards my father

137
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,020
I felt a sense of respect, you know

138
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,940
Yeah, it's like, Dad is so cool

139
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,560
I mean, he's a samurai, right? It's like he's at a dead end and then there's that whole seppuku vibe

140
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,430
It's really the spirit of a samurai

141
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,980
When you say 'Samurai Spirits', I think people who know about that

142
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,390
early adopter from some weird text site

143
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:27,390
would burst out laughing

144
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,730
Well, it was something like the early adopter, and I was making fun of it

145
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,170
Actually, robots have developed quite a bit too

146
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,190
That's fine, but you know...

147
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,670
It's the spirit of the samurai. It sounds completely different, though

148
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,040
I thought I saw the spirit of the samurai

149
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,590
It's Shibata Katsuie, right?

150
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,890
Like, look at my guts, or something

151
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,570
Pulling out my guts, like, boom, guts explosion, you know? Oh,

152
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,570
it's like a man's (otoko) way of dying,

153
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,890
like a samurai, you know?

154
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:08,860
I thought, for the first time, how cool it is and how amazing it is

155
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,110
Hmm, yeah

156
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,980
It's like, 'Son, watch how I die.'

157
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,280
It's like the final teaching

158
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,790
I don't have the first

159
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,870
teaching (laughs),

160
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,020
but I only have the last teaching

161
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,430
The last teaching is also silent, but isn't it too quiet, like, too taciturn? I think so,

162
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,620
but how should I put it?

163
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,560
It feels like being hit with tacit knowledge, you know?

164
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,740
It's like saying, 'Just watch how I die.'

165
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,280
Wow, that's really cool

166
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,400
Dad, is that how you overcome the fear of death?

167
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,790
That's amazing, right?

168
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,320
Thinking about it that way, I respect Dad

169
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,730
It's not like I ever really disliked him

170
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,700
I always thought he was a kind person

171
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,850
I thought I was a weak person

172
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,050
To be honest, I'm too weak towards my mother

173
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,450
I wish you would rebel a little, you know?

174
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,900
It's like, you should dominate a bit, you know, like a man

175
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,560
While thinking about those cries from the heart,

176
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,990
I find myself looking at my father

177
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,510
Is there going to be a big turnaround at the very end?

178
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,200
It's that kind of delightful surprise

179
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:32,190
Yeah, right, I thought it was amazing. But on the other hand, there’s this image of a weak person, um, like a father figure, you know?

180
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,320
Thinking about that,

181
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,070
In that situation, trying to escape from the pain, trying to escape

182
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,120
In conclusion, I think that the idea of suicide

183
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
as an escape might be closer to the true nature of things

184
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,690
But when I think about it like that,

185
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,590
It's like, that's me,

186
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,590
right? Like, that's me right now

187
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,020
For the first time, I thought, 'I'm my father's child.' It's a strange connection,

188
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,240
but I am definitely my dad's kid

189
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,760
It's me, you know

190
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,060
But that escape isn't 100%

191
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,280
an escape, right?

192
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:22,230
I think I'm wrapped in kindness. I think I'm wrapped in love. So,

193
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,940
In the end, I get caught up in my worries,

194
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,270
and it makes me feel a bit depressed and makes me want to run away, but,

195
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,500
But you know, that's kindness taking off

196
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,730
It's like kindness is taking off

197
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,370
Kindness starts. It's overflowing with love for others. That's right

198
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,600
So, for love, I'm running away

199
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,560
It's a runaway love, isn't it?

200
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,350
That's kind of like that

201
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,970
There are definitely songs like that. I don't know, but there must be something

202
00:13:48,970 --> 00:14:09,180
A love escape. Should I Google it? A love escape. A love escape

203
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,320
A love memory? A love love escape. Who was it? Ah, a foreigner, come out Wikipedia

204
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,810
Wikipedia. Hmm, I don't think so

205
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,050
It feels kind of like a movie. There are too many love escapes, how many are there?

206
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,800
Is everyone interested in such a theme? I wonder what it is

207
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:46,660
Netflix, a drama film from West Germany and Finland in 1986

208
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:56,180
Wasn't there a song about a love escape? A love escape song. Akashi and Secret, who is that? Is the love escape someone really obscure?

209
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:03,320
Who is this? I wonder if there's no song like that by Secret

210
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,900
Misora Ai. Escape, it's Akari Kito, right?

211
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,870
That's the Nezuko from Demon Slayer, right? It's kind of silly

212
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,880
Yeah. I don't watch it

213
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,320
A love escape, huh? I guess it doesn't really matter,

214
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,940
I got off topic

215
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:36,050
Um, what was it? Right, it comes from a weakness of the heart, but it starts with love, doesn't it?

216
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,330
Love for children and such

217
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,720
It's like the love for a mother

218
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,690
that leads to the result of suicide

219
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,730
So, you see, suicide is like that

220
00:15:48,730 --> 00:16:03,150
I couldn't really believe it. We went to the funeral, and then, sure enough,

221
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:13,190
there was a faint mark around the neck, like a diagonal, um, what do you call it? It had a faint purple hue, probably something the funeral director tried to cover up with makeup for the deceased

222
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:19,900
Even so, there was that faint mark, you know,

223
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,330
like what you often see in 'The Women of the Forensic Science Lab' or whatever it's called

224
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,690
Is it called a linear mark (correctly, it's 'sakujo-kon')? I forgot,

225
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:32,290
but it was something like that,

226
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,170
like a hanging mark, and I needed to get a family register

227
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,630
When I got my family register, it was recorded as hanging suicide

228
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,140
Well, the term hanging suicide is written with this really difficult kanji, and yeah,

229
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:48,400
it's just one of those complicated characters

230
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,060
Looking at that, I thought, wow,

231
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,570
I really did hang myself to death

232
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,950
I wasn't present at the scene of that hanging suicide, so I didn't really understand it

233
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,340
So, um, I guess my perception of that was kind of vague

234
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:16,500
At the funeral, or rather, before the funeral, during the wake,

235
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,190
they tell you to clean the body with a cloth or something, right? (That's what the funeral home staff instructs you to do.)

236
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,340
At that time, you know, I realized again, yeah

237
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah, my legs were super thin at that time, like, with legs this thin

238
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,040
I was walking for about 70 meters

239
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,920
I wonder what I was thinking while walking, you know, I imagine it

240
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,330
But no matter how I imagine it, only kind words come to mind

241
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,200
I was that kind of person

242
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,810
who probably thought kind things

243
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,030
It's heartbreaking, you know

244
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,300
I'm really sorry, Dad, and my feelings are incredibly strong

245
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,110
No, I really caused a lot of trouble for you, Dad

246
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,910
It's mainly a financial hassle, you know

247
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:11,090
I really regret not being able to apologize for that,

248
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,610
and it's been weighing on my mind

249
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,110
Starting a diet,

250
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,370
huh? (laughs) What a punchline

251
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,150
What kind of development is this?

252
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:26,910
Yeah, that's the kind of story it is

253
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:32,100
So it's amazing. You've awakened, right?

254
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,230
I know it's a bit self-serving to say,

255
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,100
but you know that moment in Dragon Ball

256
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,300
when Krillin gets killed, right?

257
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,400
It's like, 'Krillin!' Boom!

258
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,570
That's the trigger for becoming a Super Saiyan

259
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,490
It's probably when Krillin was killed, right?

260
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,580
Well, I don't remember exactly, but you know

261
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,550
That's the kind of brain-internal Krillin I have

262
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:55,130
My brain-internal Krillin was killed by my father's suicide

263
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,280
And then, like, boom! It's like awakening into a Super Saiyan

264
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,930
Well, it feels like I'm awakening

265
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:05,300
Also, what are you doing, by the way?

266
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,570
Yeah. No, but seriously, it was developing a lot inside me

267
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,880
Only in my head, yeah

268
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,920
How the body is already a lazy human

269
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:23,100
As for the body, it's so slow. So, how many minutes have passed?

270
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,610
How many minutes have passed?

271
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:34,510
So it's been 20 minutes. I see

272
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,290
Should I wrap it up here? I've talked about the mental image of Krillin

273
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:55,870
So, is everything generally okay? I'll bring up the finer details later, but essentially, it was the trigger for my suicidal thoughts that made me start thinking I needed to change my way of living; that's the origin, right?

274
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,100
And that's how I got to where I am now

275
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,920
Well, the developments from the diet are interesting too

276
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,270
I really want to talk about that, I can't help it

277
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,570
If I start talking about that, it will be really long

278
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,050
It might take about 5 hours. Or maybe not even 5 hours

279
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:16,900
Well, my father's death was shocking. I mean, it was shocking, but at the same time, it wasn't

280
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:26,850
It gradually hits me, and when I imagine those last few moments of my father, you know...

281
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,260
I can't help but cry, cry, it's just how it is

282
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,660
It's like I remember my father's kindness, you know?

283
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,110
At the same time, I think,

284
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,420
'Hey, this is what

285
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,940
it means to be a man.'

286
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,030
What are you up to?

287
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,540
Like, my son

288
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:53,860
I really felt and appreciated that strong patriarchal message

289
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,520
It's like I've regained my respect for my father

290
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:07,480
I was really happy about that. It might be a bit strange to say that respect came after contemplating suicide,

291
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:14,850
but it really resonated with my heart. Until I truly changed

292
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,800
It has taken me five years to get to this point

293
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,020
Well, it hasn't changed even now

294
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,460
My mental state is really something

295
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,820
It's always spinning in my head

296
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,290
So, in my mind, I'm making progress

297
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,500
The body isn't keeping up,

298
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,770
so it's designed for laziness,

299
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:48,080
that's how it feels

300
00:21:48,080 --> 00:22:01,240
At the very end, a huge turnaround, full respect for my father. Wow, this person is amazing, really great

301
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,960
Being able to respect my father

302
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,010
Hmm, it's about the patriarchal aspect

303
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,990
It's something I can respect. Hmm, that's why

304
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,380
I've been thinking about it for a long time

305
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,780
If my father had a motherly personality and my mother had a fatherly personality,

306
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:19,360
how much easier would that have been? I mean, when I was going to advance my studies, I told my mother,

307
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,340
My mother would do everything she could for me

308
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,000
If my father, with his strange obsession with academic credentials, was actually smart,

309
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,810
It's like, 'Study hard here and go to a good university,' which is a patriarchal approach,

310
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,170
right? If it was like that,

311
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:45,500
it would be like a mother who just obediently follows a kind and quiet father

312
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,240
There are times when I really think about how much better

313
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,330
it could have been

314
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,600
Yeah, that's really important

315
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,940
That paternal and maternal nature were completely opposite, you know

316
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:04,380
The reversal of paternal and maternal roles. It's something important

317
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm doing it while taking notes, you know

318
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,420
It's for my own use, and I plan to share it with others later, but that's fine, right? Hehehe

319
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:21,760
Such a casual way to approach skills. I can only think about the requirements

320
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,930
I'm just speaking off the top of my head. That's right

321
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:37,960
The injustice of fatherhood feels different. It feels like a reversal of fatherhood

322
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,690
It's turning into a really long story

323
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:49,000
But I want to dig deeper into it, that's true, but you know, my dad is going bald

324
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:03,810
My mother has a balding look. Yeah, that's right. She's balding, so it's a young baldness

325
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:15,610
It seems like she started losing hair when she was young, and I think that's become one of my father's complexes. It's related to women and various other things, so it's like a young baldness complex. It's not something to take notes on

326
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:29,690
Dad has a young baldness complex

327
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,130
That's also an important factor

328
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,940
Hmm, that's amazing

329
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,390
Themes keep coming up one after another

330
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,480
The conversation isn't over yet

331
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,520
Writing the document isn't finished either

332
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Isn't it endless

333
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,650
that my work never seems to end?

334
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,610
The more I talk, the more themes come up

335
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,700
Ah, well, that's going to make the conversation long

336
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,710
I'll cut it off around here

337
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,380
Well, I guess it won't come out anymore for now

338
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,080
It's going to be okay, right?

339
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,900
Hmm, well even if it does come out,

340
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,640
we'll talk about it again later

341
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,190
Hmm, I ended up talking for another 25 minutes like that

342
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,660
I'm sorry, well then
